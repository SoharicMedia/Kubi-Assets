# Kubifaktorium Asset Pack
<p>This project started off life as several small modifications for Kubifaktorium, messing around with base game files. Now that mods are supported in a better way, the base game files can be left alone and mods installed and uninstalled very easily.</p>

<p>To install, simply extract this repository into Kubifaktorium's <i>Mods</i> folder.</p>
