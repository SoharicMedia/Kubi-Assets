# Kubifaktorium Asset Pack
<p>This project started off life as several small modifications for Kubifaktorium, messing around with base game files. Now that mods are supported in a better way, the base game files can be left alone and mods installed and uninstalled very easily.</p>
<p><b>Installation</b><p>
<p>To install, simply extract this repository into Kubifaktorium's <i>Mods</i> folder.</p>
<p><b>Contents</b></p>
<p><ul>	
<li>Iron Street Lamps</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Full details of what this package contains can be found: https://soharicmedia.com/kubifaktorium/asset-pack</p>
<p>Please report any issues via GitHub Issues so that we can work on a solution. :)</p>
